/*
 * Let's first model the Tropical rain belt across the solar equator.
 * This mechanism is convection.
 * 
 * Convection knowledge:
 * Air is heated by solar radiation, especially along the solar equator.
 * Hot air is less dense than cold air. Hot air rises. Cold air falls.
 * Warmer air is able to retain more moisture than colder air.
 * Moist air is less dense than dry air.
 * When the warmer air is replaced by colder air, the colder air cannot absorb
 *     moisture. The excess moisture coalesces and then falls as rain due to
 *     gravity.
 * 
 * -- So due to tilt of the earth, we have a rain belt that moves to follow the
 *    seasonal solar equator.
 * 
 * Altitude knowledge:
 * Temperature falls with altitude.
 * Air pressure falls linearly with altitude.
 * Air density generally falls with altitude.
 * Rising air cools, cool air increases in density, and condenses causing rain.
 * Density of air is inversely proportional to temperature (cold = dense)
 * This is more pronounced when a mountain forces air to rise quickly.
 * 
 * High density air from a high elevation going down a slope causes
 * Katabatic winds due to acceleration due to gravity.
 * These can be cold and intense. But sinking air warms which means it can
 * hold more water.
 * 
 * -- So we can model the effects of mountains which give interesting wind
 *    speeds, temperatures, and rain shadows.
 * 
 * Simulating air will need require measure of air moisture, air density, air
 * temperature, air speed, and a 3D position.
 * 
 * We will need to model what happens when air collides - friction,
 * elastic collision, etc.
 * 
 * Individual particles do not have density -- only a mass of air as a whole.
 * If we have enough particles, density is implicit (i.e. density = particles
 * divided by volume).
 * 
 * Let's try a simple model: cells across a grid of size 128x128x8
 * 
 * Convection:
 * -- Each cell can be heated/cooled by the land beneath it.
 * -- Each cell can receive moisture from the land beneath it.
 * -- Hot air increases pressure, so pushes out & up, reducing density in the
 *        current cell and increasing density in adjacent and (mainly) above
 *        cells (direction can be implicit due to adjacent cells of equal
 *        pressure all wanting to push up to a low pressure area
 *        instead of adjacently).
 * -- Cold air is denser, so pushes into less dense cells, reducing temperature.
 *        This is due to gravity. Pressure caused by density can be compared
 *        to pressure caused by kinetic energy from gravitational acceleration.
 * -- Cold cells can hold less moisture, so rain sooner and rain colder.
 * -- Raining reduces moisture held in a cell.
 * 
 * The key point is WIND MOVEMENT IS CAUSED BY DIFFERENCES IN PRESSURE
 * 
 * And at the end we want to display:
 * -- Wind speed at the surface cells.
 * -- Air pressure.
 * -- Rainfall quantity & temperature.
