[hexgen2014 world generator](http://www.heroextant.net/hexgen2014/)
============================

This is a program for creating nice looking images of a world map and simulating weather. Maps are randomly generated using entirely procedural methods.

**TODO SCREENSHOT**

In 2010, the [Hero Extant World Generator prototype](http://www.tophatstuff.co.uk/archive.php?p=99) was released with a GUI for Windows. The world-generator backend has now been updated and converted into a command-line tool, *hexgen2014*, by the original author. Several improvements have been made. The tool is written in C and available as free & open source software for Windows and Linux.

It is hoped that you will find this program useful as a standalone tool for your own projects. Alternatively you may like to use the world generator source code in your own programs.

Updated versions of this software can always be found at the [website](http://www.heroextant.net/hexgen2014/) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/golightlyb/hexgen2014). Bug reports and feedback can be sent to hexgen2014@heroextant.net. Thanks!

New Features
------------

Improving over all previous releases:

**Advanced weather simulation!** Atmosphere, wind and weather are simulated in incredible detail. Weather changes over time.

**Seasons!** Seasonal variation over the same map is now supported by varying axial tilt. This is then automatically factored into the new weather simulation.

**Improved terrain generation:** Terrain is generated using a new simplex noise method, replacing the old midpoint displacement algorithm. This gives greater flexibility in the shape of map and generates higher quality terrains, avoiding artifacts such as diamond shaped mountains or square shaped peninsulas.

**Custom terrain shape masks:** Generating maps in specific shapes is now possible using preset shapes or by loading a custom image as a mask.

**More customisable than ever before:** Do you want to simulate 12 months of sunlight patterns over a small island in the North? Or would you rather simulate a pattern of dry and monsoon seasons over a world-spanning continent baked in the glow of a giant sun? What about a garden world where a low axial tilt means mild seasons? Your imagination can go wild.

**LaTeX/PDF output:** Automatically generate a fancy PDF document of your world and its features using `pdflatex`. Alternatively use the generated LaTeX files as the basis for your own worldbuilding document.

<a name="compile" />
Compile from Source
-------------------

Consult the documentation for more detailed information.

The given build process was designed for 64-bit Debian (stable); users of other systems
may want to follow the instructions in the documentation instead.

Requires:
[tup](http://gittup.org/tup/),
gcc,
clang

Optional:
[debian Multiarch](https://wiki.debian.org/Multiarch/HOWTO),
[gcc-mingw-w64](https://packages.debian.org/wheezy/gcc-mingw-w64),
[wine64](http://wiki.winehq.org/Wine64),
[fabric](http://www.fabfile.org/)


    git clone https://github.com/golightlyb/hexgen2014
    cd hexgen2010
    nano tup.config # turn target platforms on/off
    tup init
    tup upd

If you make changes after this point, simply run `tup upd` to update the build.


<a name="ports" />
Additional Ports
----------------

* [Original Cobra version of the Hero Extant 2010 World Generator Prototype](http://www.tophatstuff.co.uk/archive.php?p=99)  
Comes with a graphical user interface. The compiler for this version is no longer published, so you cannot modify the software unfortunately.

* [Java port of the Hero Extant 2010 World Generator](https://github.com/avh4/hero-extant)  
This is a Java version of the world generator backend suitable for including in Java projects.
