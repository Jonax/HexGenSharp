HexGenSharp
============================

A C# port of Ben Golightly's [Hero Extant 2014 World generator](https://github.com/golightlyb/hexgen2014), a program for procedurally generating  world map with simulating weather. 

Once porting is complete, the intention is to split the program into two - A weaponised library for use in other .NET projects, and separate command-line application to support a multitude of parameters.

Features
------------

**Advanced weather simulation!** Atmosphere, wind and weather are simulated in incredible detail. Weather changes over time.

**Seasons!** Seasonal variation over the same map is now supported by varying axial tilt. This is then automatically factored into the new weather simulation.

**Improved terrain generation:** Terrain is generated using a simplex noise method combined with MurmurHash3. This gives greater flexibility in the shape of map and generates higher quality terrains, avoiding artifacts such as diamond shaped mountains or square shaped peninsulas.

**Custom terrain shape masks:** Generating maps in specific shapes is now possible using preset shapes or by loading a custom image as a mask.

**More customisable than ever before:** Do you want to simulate 12 months of sunlight patterns over a small island in the North? Or would you rather simulate a pattern of dry and monsoon seasons over a world-spanning continent baked in the glow of a giant sun? What about a garden world where a low axial tilt means mild seasons? Your imagination can go wild.

This image shows a large area over the equator. Sticking to only one hemisphere is fun too. You can control the planet's axial tilt for milder (or harsher!) seasons. |
